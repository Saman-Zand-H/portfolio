# Portfolio

![CI/CD](![Build](https://github.com/Saman-Zand-H/portfolio/actions/workflows/main.yml))

This is my personal portfolio. It uses `Vue.js` as the front-end framework, `Django` as the back-end framework, `REST` and `GraphQL` for API, `Postgresql` as the database, `Daphne` as the webserver for serving HTTP 2 requests, `NGINX` as the reverse proxy, and `docker-compose.prod.yml` for managing containers.

Even though the project is deployed, it's still in its early stages of development.
