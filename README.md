# Portolio

This is my personal portfolio. It uses `Vue.js` as the front-end framework, `Django` as the back-end framework, `REST` and `GraphQL` for API, `Postgresql` as the database, `Gunicorn` as the webserver, `NGINX` as the reverse proxy, and `docker-compose.prod.yml` for managing containers.

Even though the project is deployed, it's still in its early stages of development.
